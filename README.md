#RC CAR

RC Car Overview
An RC (Remote Control) car using ESP8266 modules is a great project that combines wireless communication with motor control and servo mechanisms. This setup typically involves two main components: the transmitter (controller) and the receiver (car).

Transmitter Side
On the transmitter side, an ESP8266 communicates with an Arduino via serial communication. A joystick connected to the Arduino controls the forward and backward motion of the car. The Arduino reads the joystick's position, which determines the speed and direction of the motors. A second joystick connected to the ESP8266â€™s A0 pin adjusts the angle of the servo, allowing for precise turning of the car.

Receiver Side
At the receiver side, another ESP8266 is connected to an L298n motor driver, which controls the motors for driving the RC car. A servo motor, connected to the ESP8266, is used for steering.

Key Components
ESP8266 Modules: Enable wireless communication between the transmitter and receiver.
Arduino: Processes joystick inputs and sends commands to the ESP8266 for motor and servo control.
L298N Motor Driver: Controls the motors based on commands from the ESP8266, allowing for both forward and backward motion.
Servo Motor: Adjusts the steering based on joystick input from the transmitter side.
Joysticks: Provide user input for controlling motion and steering.
Battery:for providing supply to the esp8266,arduino and motor driver l298n
BO Motors and Wheels:for rotating purpose
Functionality
Forward/Backward Motion: The joystick on the transmitter controls the speed and direction of the RC car through the Arduino and ESP8266 communication.
Steering Control: The joystick on the receiver side adjusts the servo position, allowing the car to turn as desired.
Conclusion
This RC car project effectively demonstrates the integration of wireless communication, motor control, and user input. It provides a fun and educational experience in robotics and electronics, showcasing how multiple components can work together to achieve a common goal.
